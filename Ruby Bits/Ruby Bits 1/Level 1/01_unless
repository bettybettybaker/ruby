Challenge:
We're putting together a system to manage our vast video game collection that we just can't seem to part with. Using if with negative conditions can be tough to read. Refactor the code below to use unless rather than if.

games = ["Super Mario Bros.", "Contra", "Metroid", "Mega Man 2"]
if !games.empty?
  puts "Games in your vast collection: #{games.count}"
end

=end


#################### Solution ####################

games = ["Super Mario Bros.", "Contra", "Metroid", "Mega Man 2"]
unless games.empty?
  puts "Games in your vast collection: #{games.count}"
end
